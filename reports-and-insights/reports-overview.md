# Reports Overview

This section provides an overview of the reporting and insight
capabilities implemented within the Project Server (PWA)
environment.

The reporting structure was designed to support both
operational project tracking and management-level decision making,
with a clear separation between project, portfolio, and cost views.

## Report Categories

### 1. Project-Level Reports
These reports focused on individual project performance and were
primarily used by project managers and team leads.

Typical insights included:
- Project progress (% complete)
- Task status (on-time, late, upcoming)
- Timeline visibility and milestone tracking
- Planned vs actual execution status

---

### 2. Portfolio / Multi-Project Reports
Portfolio-level reports provided visibility across multiple projects
and were mainly used by PMO and senior management.

Key objectives:
- Compare progress across projects
- Identify delayed or high-risk projects
- Monitor overall portfolio health
- Support prioritization and escalation decisions

---

### 3. Cost and Resource-Oriented Reports
Cost-related reporting focused on visibility rather than detailed
financial disclosure.

These reports helped to:
- Track cost-type resources at project level
- Understand cost allocation trends
- Support resource planning and governance
- Align project execution with budget awareness

---

## Reporting Structure

Reports were organized in a structured and time-based manner:
- Project-specific folders
- Monthly reporting cycles
- Clear separation between test, draft, and final reports

This structure ensured consistency, traceability, and ease of access
for different stakeholder roles.

## Design Principles

The reporting layer was built around the following principles:
- Simplicity over complexity
- Actionable insights rather than raw data
- Role-based visibility (PM, PMO, Management)
- Security and data sensitivity awareness

All reports and screenshots in this repository are sanitized and do
not expose real organizational data.
