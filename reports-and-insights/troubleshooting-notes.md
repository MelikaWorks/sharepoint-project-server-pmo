# Troubleshooting Notes

This document summarizes the troubleshooting approach and
problem-solving patterns applied during the implementation
and operation of the SharePoint Project Server (PWA)
environment.

Rather than listing step-by-step technical solutions, this
document focuses on the methodology used to analyze, isolate,
and resolve issues in a real-world enterprise setup.

## Common Categories of Issues Encountered

During the lifecycle of the system, several recurring types
of issues were encountered, including:

- Service availability and performance-related issues
- Configuration inconsistencies between environments
- Permission and access-related problems
- Reporting and data refresh inconsistencies
- Dependency-related behaviors between Project Server and SharePoint components

Each issue was analyzed within its operational context
before applying corrective actions.

## Troubleshooting Methodology

The following structured approach was consistently used when
addressing issues:

1. Problem identification based on user impact and system behavior
2. Verification of recent changes or configuration updates
3. Isolation of the affected component (service, configuration, or permission)
4. Review of logs, system status, and related dependencies
5. Validation of the solution in a controlled manner
6. Documentation of the resolution for future reference

This approach helped avoid ad-hoc fixes and reduced the risk
of introducing new issues.

## Documentation and Knowledge Retention

All resolved issues were documented internally to create a
personal troubleshooting knowledge base.

The goal of this documentation was:
- Faster resolution of recurring issues
- Improved understanding of system behavior over time
- Reduced dependency on external references
- Knowledge retention for long-term system maintenance

The original troubleshooting notes and detailed references
are intentionally not included in this public repository.

## Key Takeaways

- Structured troubleshooting is more effective than reactive fixes
- Understanding system dependencies is critical in enterprise platforms
- Clear documentation significantly reduces future maintenance effort
- Experience-based knowledge complements official documentation

This document reflects the problem-solving mindset applied
throughout the project rather than specific technical fixes.
