# KPI and Progress Analysis

This document describes how key performance indicators (KPIs)
and progress metrics were used to monitor project execution
and support decision-making within the Project Server (PWA)
environment.

The focus was on clarity, early risk detection, and actionable
insights rather than raw metrics.

## Key Progress Indicators

### 1. Progress Percentage (% Complete)
Project progress was primarily tracked using percentage-based
completion metrics.

Rather than treating % complete as a standalone indicator, it
was always interpreted in the context of:
- Planned timeline
- Remaining duration
- Upcoming milestones

This prevented misleading progress reporting where high
completion percentages masked schedule risks.

---

### 2. Late vs Due Tasks
Task-level status was classified into:
- Late tasks
- Due (upcoming) tasks
- On-track tasks

This classification helped shift focus from overall progress
to immediate execution risks and bottlenecks.

Managers were able to quickly identify:
- Critical delays
- Repeated late patterns
- Areas requiring intervention

---

### 3. Timeline and Milestone Visibility
Timeline-based views were used to provide a clear picture of:
- Key milestones
- Dependency chains
- Schedule compression risks

Milestones played a central role in executive-level reporting,
as they offered a concise view of project health without
overloading detail.

## Portfolio-Level Progress Analysis

At portfolio level, progress analysis focused on comparison
rather than individual task detail.

Key questions addressed:
- Which projects are behind schedule?
- Which projects show consistent delay trends?
- Where are management interventions required?

This enabled prioritization and escalation decisions at PMO
and management levels.

## Cost and Resource Awareness

Progress analysis was complemented by high-level cost and
resource visibility.

Rather than detailed financial reporting, the emphasis was on:
- Identifying cost-intensive project phases
- Monitoring resource allocation trends
- Supporting planning and governance decisions

This ensured progress tracking remained aligned with
resource and budget awareness.

## Design Philosophy

The KPI and progress analysis layer was designed around:
- Early detection of risk
- Visual clarity over data density
- Consistent interpretation across projects
- Support for both operational and strategic decisions
