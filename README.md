# Enterprise SharePoint Project Server (PWA) – Case Study

This repository presents a sanitized, real-world enterprise case study
of **SharePoint Project Server (PWA)**, focused on portfolio management,
project governance, reporting, and resource/cost awareness.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate system design,
administration, and analytical thinking, rather than to provide
deployment scripts or raw configuration files.

---

## Scope of the Case Study

This case study covers the following areas:

- Multi-project and portfolio-level visibility
- Project Web App (PWA) configuration and usage
- Project governance with controlled task management
- Custom views across project, task, resource, and cost dimensions
- KPI-based progress monitoring and reporting
- Enterprise-level resource and cost awareness
- Structured troubleshooting and documentation practices

All content has been anonymized and sanitized.

## My Role

In this project, I was responsible for the end-to-end setup,
configuration, and operational support of the Project Server
environment, with responsibilities including:

- SharePoint / Project Server administration
- PMO systems implementation and support
- Reporting and governance design
- Resource and cost structure coordination

This was a live production environment used by multiple projects.

## Screenshots

The `screenshots` folder contains selected and sanitized screenshots
illustrating key aspects of the system, including:

- Project Center and portfolio-level views
- Project-level dashboards and timelines
- Custom PWA views and governance controls
- Resource and cost-related configurations

Screenshots are intentionally limited to highlight system structure
and design, rather than expose operational or sensitive data.

---

## Reporting and Analysis

Detailed explanations of the reporting structure and progress
analysis are provided in the following documents:

- `reports-and-insights/reports-overview.md`
- `reports-and-insights/kpi-and-progress-analysis.md`

These documents focus on how insights were derived and applied
to support decision-making, rather than on raw data or metrics.

---

## Lessons Learned

Practical insights gained from operating the system in a real
enterprise environment are documented in the following files:

- `reports-and-insights/lessons-learned.md`
- `lessons-learned.md`

These reflections focus on governance, user adoption, and
analytical considerations, rather than tool-specific limitations.

---

## Troubleshooting Approach

A high-level overview of the troubleshooting methodology and
problem-solving mindset applied throughout the project is available in:

- `architecture-and-design/troubleshooting-notes.md`

Detailed, step-by-step fixes and internal references are
intentionally excluded from this public repository.

---

## Data Sanitization Notice

All materials in this repository have been sanitized to remove:

- Organization and company identifiers
- User names and personal data
- Server names, URLs, and infrastructure details
- Real cost figures and sensitive timelines
