# Enterprise SharePoint Project Server (PWA) – Case Study

This repository presents a sanitized, real-world case study of an
enterprise implementation of **SharePoint Project Server (PWA)**,
focused on portfolio management, project governance, reporting,
and resource/cost awareness.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate system design,
administration, and analytical thinking rather than to provide
deployment scripts or raw configuration files.

---

## Scope of the Case Study

This case study covers:

- Multi-project and portfolio visibility
- Project Web App (PWA) configuration
- Project governance and controlled task management
- Custom views for project, task, resource, and cost perspectives
- KPI-based progress monitoring and reporting
- Resource and cost awareness at enterprise level
- Structured troubleshooting and documentation practices

All content has been anonymized and sanitized.

## My Role

In this project, I was responsible for the end-to-end setup,
configuration, and operational support of the Project Server
environment, acting as:

- SharePoint / Project Server Administrator
- PMO Systems Specialist
- Reporting and governance designer
- Resource and cost structure coordinator

This was a live production environment used by multiple projects.

## Screenshots

The `screenshots` folder contains selected and sanitized screenshots
illustrating key aspects of the system, including:

- Project Center and portfolio views
- Project-level dashboards and timelines
- Custom PWA views and governance controls
- Resource and cost-related configurations

Screenshots are intentionally limited to highlight structure and
design rather than expose operational data.

---

## Reporting and Analysis

Detailed explanations of reporting logic and progress analysis
can be found in:

- `reports-and-insights/reports-overview.md`
- `reports-and-insights/kpi-and-progress-analysis.md`

These documents focus on how insights were derived and used for
decision-making, not on raw data or metrics.

---

## Lessons Learned

Practical insights gained from operating the system in a real
enterprise environment are documented in:

- `reports-and-insights/lessons-learned.md`
- `lessons-learned.md`

These reflections highlight governance, adoption, and analytical
lessons rather than tool limitations.

---

## Troubleshooting Approach

A high-level overview of the troubleshooting methodology and
problem-solving mindset used throughout the project is available in:

- `architecture-and-design/troubleshooting-notes.md`

Step-by-step fixes and internal references are intentionally excluded.

---

## Data Sanitization Notice

All materials in this repository have been sanitized to remove:

- Organization and company identifiers
- User names and personal data
- Server names, URLs, and infrastructure details
- Real cost figures and sensitive timelines

For details, see:
- `masking-rules.md`
