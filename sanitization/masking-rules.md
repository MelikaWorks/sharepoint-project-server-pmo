## What Has Been Preserved

To maintain the educational and professional value of the
case study, the following elements have been preserved:

## Sanitization Principles

The sanitization process followed these principles:

- Remove identifiers that could link content to a real organization
- Avoid publishing raw data when summarized insight is sufficient
- Prefer structural examples over literal screenshots where possible
- Ensure no single artifact can be used to reconstruct real data

## Intent and Responsibility

This repository is intended solely as a professional case study
demonstrating experience with enterprise systems such as
